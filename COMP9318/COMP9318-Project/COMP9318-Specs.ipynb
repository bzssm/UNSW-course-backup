    "\n",
    "* You are required to complete your implementation in a file `submission.py` provided along with this notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "* This notebook encompasses all the requisite details regarding the project. Detailed instructions including **CONSTRAINTS**, **FEEDBACK** and **EVALUATION** are provided in respective sections. In case of additional problem, you can post your query @ Piazza.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This project is **time-consuming**, so it is highly advised that you start working on this as early as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are allowed to use only the permitted libraries and modules (as mentioned in the **CONSTRAINTS** section). You should not import unnecessary modules/libraries, failing to import such modules at test time will lead to errors.\n",

    "* You are **NOT ALLOWED** to use dictionaries and/or external data resources for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will provide you **LIMITED FEEDBACK** for your submission (only **15** attempts allowed to each group). Instructions for the **FEEDBACK** and final submission are given in the **SUBMISSION** section.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For **Final Evaluation** we will be using a different dataset, so your final scores may vary.  \n",

    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Project, you are required to devise an algorithm/technique to fool a binary classifier named `target-classifier`. In this regard, you only have access to following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. The `target-classifier` is a binary classifier classifying data to two categories, $\\textit{i.e.}$, **class-1** and **class-0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You have access to part of classifiers' training data, $\\textit{i.e.}$, a sample of 540 paragraphs. 180 for **class-1**, and 360 for **class-0**, provided in the files: `class-1.txt` and `class-0.txt` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `target-classifier` belong to the SVM family.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The `target-classifier` allows **EXACTLY 20 DISTINCT** modifications in each test sample.\n",
    "5. You are provided with a test sample of **200** paragraphs from **class-1** (in the file: `test_data.txt`). You can use these test samples to get feedback from the target classifier (**only 15 attempts** allowed to each group.).\n",
    "6. **NOTE: You are not allowed to use the data `test_data.txt` for your model training (if any). VIOLATIONS in this regard will get ZERO score**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "### -to-do:\n",
    "* You are required to come up with an algorithm named `fool_classifier()` that makes best use of the above-mentioned information (**point 1-4**) to fool the `target-classifier`. By fooling the classifier we mean that your algorithm can help mis-classify a bunch of test instances (**point-5**) with minimal possible modifications (**EXACTLY 20 DISTINCT** modifications allowed to each test sample). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **NOTE::** We put a **harsh limit** on the number of modifications allowed for each test instance. You are only allowed to modify each test sample by **EXACTLY 20 DISTINCT tokens (NO MORE NO LESS)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NOTE::** **ADDING** or **DELETING** one word at a time is **ONE** modification. Replacement will be considered as **TWO** modifications $(\\textit{i.e.,}$ **Deletion** followed by **Insertion**)."

    "Your implementation `submission.py` should comply with following constraints.\n",

    "1. You should implement your methodology using `Python3`.\n",
    "* You should implement your code in the function `fool_classifier()` in the file `submission.py`. \n",
    "* You are only allowed to use pre-defined class `strategy()` defined in the file: `helper.py` in order to train your models (if any). \n",
    "* You **should not** do any pre-processing on the data. We have already pre-processed the data for you.  \n",
    "* You are supposed to implement your algorithm using **scikit-learn (version=0.19.1)**. We will **NOT** accept implementations using other Libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are **not supposed to augment** the data using external/additional resources.  You are only allowed to use the partial training data provided to you ($\\textit{i.e.,} $ `class-1.txt` and `class-0.txt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are **not** allowed to use the test samples ($\\textit{i.e.,}$ `test_data.txt`) for model training and/or inference building. You can only use this data for testing, $\\textit{i.e.,}$ calculating success %-age (as described in the **EVALUATION** section.). **VIOLATIONS IN THIS REGARD WILL GET ZERO SCORE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are **not** allowed to hard code the ground truth and any other information into your implementation `submission.py`. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Considering the **RUNNING TIME**, your implementation is supposed to read the test data file ($\\textit{i.e.,}$ `test_data.txt` with 200 test samples), process it and write the modified file (`modified_data.txt`) within **12 Minutes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each modified test sample in the modified file (`modified_data.txt`) should not differ from the original test sample corresponding to the file (`test_data.txt`) by more than 20 tokens.\n",

    "### FEEDBACK:\n",
    "* For this project, we will provide real-time feed-back on a test data ($\\textit{i.e.,}$ the file `test_data.txt` containing **200** test cases).\n",
    "* Each group is allowed to avail only **15 attempts in TOTAL**, so use your attempts **WISELY**.\n",
    "* We will only provide **ACCUMULATIVE FEEDBACK** ($\\textit{i.e.,}$ how many modified test samples out of **200** were classified as Class-0). We **WILL NOT** provide detailed feedback for individual test cases.\n",
    "* For the feedback, you are required to submit the modified text file ($\\textit{i.e.,}$ `modified_data.txt`) via the submission portal: http://kg.cse.unsw.edu.au:8318/project/ (using Group name and Group password).\n",
    "* **NOTE::** Please make sure that the modified text file is generated by your program `fool_classifier()`, and it obeys the modification constraints. We have provided a function named: `check_data()` in the class: `strategy()`to check whether the modified file: `modified_data.txt` obeys the constraints.\n",

    "1. For final submission, you need to submit:\n",
