    "Algorithms such as $k$-Nearest Neighbour are conceptually very simple -- we predict the class value of an unlabelled *query* data point we are given by looking at all the labelled data point(s) in our data set, and predicting that our query will have the same class as the most similar data point(s) in the training set. So, all we need is a way of measuring similarity. The well-known *Euclidean distance measure* would seem to be a good choice. However, while we are very familiar with Euclideam distance in 2 and 3-dimensions, there was a warning (Slide 33 of the \"Classification\" lecture) that in high-dimensions there is a problem – what was this problem ?

    "But what does this actually mean ? There is a mathematical argument to show that this is a true statement, but an alternative approach is simply to simulate what happens. One approach is to randomly generate $N$ points inside a $d$-dimensional cube centred around zero, such as $[-0.5, 0.5]^{d}$. Now take all pairwise distances between these points and plot them. Do this for at least 3 settings for $d$, such as $d=3$, $100$ and $1000$. Plot the pairwise distances using a histogram from the [```matplotlib```](http://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html) library. What do you observe as $d$ is increased ?

    "We got right down to the details of how a linear classifier works. Now this being a perceptron, you probably recall that rather than using a fixed set of weights to do the prediction each time, there is a simple training rule that updates the weights on the basis of discrepancies between the classifier's prediction on the data and the actual class. So we could extend our previous code to implement that training rule, but the code is a little fiddly and you're probably thinking there should be a simpler way to do this. If so, you are correct, but it is based on moving towards coding with matrix and vector operations, rather than directly using Python arrays. To do this we need to import the NumPy library (there is a tutorial at: <href <a>https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html</a>>)."

    "Finally, try this out on a real dataset, the Pima diabetes dataset. You can download this from within your program. The rest of your program should work the same. Replace the lines defining the dataset, X and y variables with the code below. You might want to increase the number of iterations from 20 as well. Unfortunately, this basic implementation of neural learning is not likely to find a very good model. Try transforming the data, for example, by make all attribute values lie in the same range. Search for methods of normalisation using the NumPy built-in functions \"np.mean()\" and \"np.var()\". "
