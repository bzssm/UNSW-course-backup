>>> dataset: mnist and cifar-10

The code is implemented for minist.

To make your presentation more convinced and attactive, you're recommended to use cifar-10, a popular dataset containing 10 categories pic.
For more info, you can download 'CIFAR-10 python version' at http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html 

After download it, you need to extract it from /data/cifar-10-python.tar.gz
then run show.py or load_cifar10.py you will see the pictures.


>>> how to run ?

install tensorflow 

1. train you classification model on mnist: python train.py 

2. perform attack: python attack.py

# run them with CPU --> you need to comment out "with device = '/gpu:0' " appearing in train.py and attack.py 


>>> what are those folders ?

1. data: contain dataset
2. model_save: the classification model obtained from Mnist.py
3. save: those pictures have been attacked. (you can show the original pic by making small change in attack.py)
