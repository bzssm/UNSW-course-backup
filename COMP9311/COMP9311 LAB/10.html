<p>
Give a brief definition for each of the following terms <small>[based on Ramakrishnan, ex.17.1]</small> :
</p>
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li> transaction
<li> dirty read
<li> serializable schedule
<li> conflict-serializable schedule
<li> view-serializable schedule
<li> two-phase locking protocol
</ol>
</p>

<?=startAnswer()?>
<ol type="a">
<li> <i>transaction</i>
<p>
An execution of a user program that performs some action that is treated
as atomic according to the semantics of some database application. The
DBMS sees the transaction as a sequence of actions that can include read
and write operations on the database, as well as computations.
</p>
<li> <i>dirty read</i>
<p>
When a  transaction reads an object that has been modified by another
not-yet-commited transaction.
</p>
<li> <i>serializable schedule</i>
<p>
A schedule over a set of transactions that produces a result that is
the same as some serial execution of the transactions.
</p>
<li> <i>conflict-serializable schedule</i>
<p>
A schedule is conflict-serializable if it is conflict-equivalent to
some serial schedule.
Two schedules are conflict-equivalent if they involve the same set
of actions and they order every pair of conflicting actions in the
same way.
</p>
<li> <i>view-serializable schedule</i>
<p>
A schedule is view-serializable if it is view-equivalent to some
serial schedule.
Two schedules are view-equivalent if they satisfy:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the initial value of any object is read by the same
	transaction in both schedules, and
<li> the final value of any object is written by the same
	transaction in both schedules, and
<li> any shared object is written-then-read by the same pair of
	transactions in both schedules.
</ul>
<p>
<li> <i>two-phase locking protocol</i>
<p>
The two-phase locking protocol is a way of ensuring that only
serializable schedules occur when transactions execute concurrently.
Under this protocol each transaction must:
</p>
<ul>
<li> acquire a shared lock on an object before reading it
<li> acquire an exclusive lock on an object before writing it
<li> not acquire any new locks once it has released a lock
</ul>
</ol>

<li>
<p>
Draw the precedence graph for the following schedule (where <tt>C</tt> means "commit"):
</p>
<pre>
T1:      R(A) W(Z)                C
T2:                R(B) W(Y)        C
T3: W(A)                     W(B)     C
</pre>

<?=startAnswer()?>
<p>
It has an edge from T3 to T1 (because of A) and an edge from
T2 to T3 because of B.
</p>
<p>
This gives: <tt>T2 --> T3 --> T1</tt>
</p>
<?=endAnswer()?>

<li>
<p>
Consider the following incomplete schedule <i>S</i> <small>[based on Ramakrishnan, ex.17.2]</small> :
</p>
<pre>
T1: R(X) R(Y) W(X)           W(X)
T2:                R(Y)           R(Y)
T3:                     W(Y)
</pre>
<ol type="a">
<p><li>
Determine (by using a precedence graph) whether the schedule is serializable
<p><li>
Modify <i>S</i> to create a complete schedule that is conflict-serializable
</ol>
<?=startAnswer()?>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>
<i>Determine (by using a precedence graph) whether the schedule is serializable</i>
<p>
The precedence graph has an edge, from <i>T1</i> to <i>T3</i>,
because of the conflict between <tt>T1:R(Y)</tt> and <tt>T3:W(Y)</tt>.
It also has an edge, from <i>T2</i> to <i>T3</i>,
because of the conflict between the first <tt>T2:R(Y)</tt> and
<tt>T3:W(Y)</tt>.
It also has an edge, from <i>T3</i> to <i>T2</i>,
because of the conflict between <tt>T3:W(Y)</tt> and the
second <tt>T2:R(Y)</tt>.
</p>
<li>
<p>
<i>Modify <i>S</i> to create a complete schedule that is conflict-serializable</i>
</p>
<p>
Trick question. It is not possible. Since the precedence graph is cyclic,
we know that it's not conflict-serializable.
</p>
<p>
If we are allowed to add <tt>abort</tt> actions (which was not mentioned
in the question), we could simply abort either <tt>T2</tt> or
<tt>T3</tt> and the schedule would become conflict-serializable.
</p>
</ol>
<?=endAnswer()?>

<li>
<p>
For each of the following schedules, state whether it is
conflict-serializable and/or view-serializable.
If you cannot decide whether a schedule belongs to either
class, explain briefly.
The actions are listed in the order they are scheduled,
and prefixed with the transaction name <small>[based on Ramakrishnan, ex.17.3]</small> :
</p>
<ol type="a">
<p><li> <code>T1:R(X) T2:R(X) T1:W(X) T2:W(X)</code>
<p><li> <code>T1:W(X) T2:R(Y) T1:R(Y) T2:R(X)</code>
<p><li> <code>T1:R(X) T2:R(Y) T3:W(X) T2:R(X) T1:R(Y)</code>
<p><li> <code>T1:R(X) T1:R(Y) T1:W(X) T2:R(Y) T3:W(Y) T1:W(X) T2:R(Y)</code>
<p><li> <code>T1:R(X) T2:W(X) T1:W(X) T3:W(X)</code>
<!--
<p><li> <code>T1:R(X) T2:W(X) T1:W(X) T2:Abort T1:Commit</code>
<p><li> <code>T1:R(X) T2:W(X) T1:W(X) T2:Commit T1:Commit</code>
<p><li> <code>T1:W(X) T2:R(X) T1:W(X) T2:Abort T1:Commit</code>
<p><li> <code>T1:W(X) T2:R(X) T1:W(X) T2:Commit T1:Commit</code>
<p><li> <code>T1:W(X) T2:R(X) T1:W(X) T2:Commit T1:Abort</code>
-->
</ol>

<?=startAnswer()?>
<p>
The methods used to determine these solutions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> for conflict-serializablility, draw precedence graph and look for cycles
<li> for view-serializablility, apply the definition from lecture notes.
</ul>
<p>
You can short-circuit the view serializability check. As soon as you
know that the schedule is conflict-serializable, it must also be view
serializable.
<p>Solutions:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p> not conflict-serializable, not view-serializable </p>
<li>
<p> conflict-serializable, view-serializable </p>
<li>
<p> conflict-serializable, view-serializable </p>
<li>
<p> not conflict-serializable, not view-serializable </p>
<li>
<p> not conflict-serializable, view-serializable (view equivalent to the serial
schedule T1, T2, T3)</p>
</ol>
<?=endAnswer()?>

<li>
<p>
Is the following schedule serializable? Show your working.
</p>
<pre>
T1:             R(X)W(X)W(Z)        R(Y)W(Y)
T2: R(Y)W(Y)R(Y)            W(Y)R(X)        W(X)R(V)W(V)
</pre>
<?=startAnswer()?>
<p>
When we talk about serializability and don't specifically say what
kind, we usually mean conflict-serializable.
As above, the "working" for this question involves constructing a
precedence graph, based on conflicting operations, and looking
for cycles.
</p>
<p>
In this case there's a conflict between <tt>T1:R(X)</tt> and
<tt>T2:W(X)</tt>, giving a graph edge from <tt>T1</tt> to <tt>T2</tt>.
There's also a conflict between <tt>T2:R(Y)</tt> and <tt>T1:W(Y)</tt>,
giving a graph edge from <tt>T2</tt> to <tt>T1</tt>.
This means the graph has a cycle, so the schedule is not serializable.
</p>
<?=endAnswer()?>

<li>
<p>
Consider the following two transactions:
</p>
<pre>
      T1               T2
 ------------     ------------
 read(A)          read(B)
 A := 10*A+4      B := 2*B+3
 write(A)         write(B)
 read(B)          read(A)
 B := 3*B         A := 100-A
 write(B)         write(A)
</pre>
<p>
<ol type="a">
<p><li>
Write versions of the above two transactions that use two-phase locking.
<p><li>
Is there a non-serial schedule for <i>T1</i> and <i>T2</i> that is
serializable? Why?
<p><li>
Can a schedule for <i>T1</i> and <i>T2</i> result in deadlock?
If so, give an example schedule. If not, explain why not.
</ol>
</p>
<?=startAnswer()?>
<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>
<i>Write versions of the above two transactions that use two-phase locking.</i>
</p>
<p>
The basic idea behind two-phase locking is that you take out all the locks
you need, do the processing, and then release the locks. Thus two-phase
implementations of <tt>T1</tt> and <tt>T2</tt> would be:
</p>
<pre>
      T1                T2
 ------------      ------------
 write_lock(A)     write_lock(B)
 read(A)           read(B)
 A := 10*A+4       B := 2*B+3
 write(A)          write(B)
 write_lock(B)     write_lock(A)
 read(B)           read(A)
 B := 3*B          A := 100-A
 write(B)          write(A)
 unlock(A)         unlock(B)
 unlock(B)         unlock(A)
</pre>
<li>
<p>
<i>Is there a non-serial schedule for <tt>T1</tt> and <tt>T2</tt> that is
serializable? Why?</i>
</p>
<p>
No. There is no such schedule.
The last operation in <tt>T1</tt> is <tt>write(B)</tt>,
and the last operation in <tt>T2</tt> is <tt>write(A)</tt>. <tt>T1</tt>
starts with <tt>read(A)</tt> and <tt>T2</tt> starts with <tt>read(B)</tt>.
Therefore, in any serializable schedule, we would require that either
<tt>read(A)</tt> in <tt>T1</tt> should  be after <tt>write(B)</tt> in
<tt>T2</tt> or <tt>read(B)</tt> in <tt>T2</tt> should be after
<tt>write(B)</tt> in <tt>T1</tt>.
</p>
<li>
<p>
<i>Can a schedule for <i>T1</i> and <i>T2</i> result in deadlock?
If so, give an example schedule. If not, explain why not.</i>
</p>
<p>
Yes. Consider the following (where <tt>L(X)</tt> denotes
taking a lock on object <tt>X</tt>):
</p>
<pre>
   T1: L(A)R(A)    W(A)L(B) ...
   T2:         L(B)        R(B)W(B)L(A) ...
</pre>
