<h3>Aims</h3>

This exercise aims to give you practice in:
<ul>
<li> asking SQL queries on a relatively simple schema
<li> using SQL aggregation and grouping operators
<li> writing SQL view definitions
</ul>
This exercise will <b>not</b> explain how
to do everything in fine detail. Part of the aim of the exercise is that you
explore how to use the PostgreSQL system.
The documentation contains much useful information:
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/index.html">PostgreSQL Manual</a>.
You should become familiar with where to find useful information in the documentation ASAP since you need to know how to use PostgreSQL to do your assignments.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
Access logs for web servers contain a considerable amount of information
that is potentially useful in tuning both the web server parameters and
the applications that run on the web server.
A web server access log contains one entry for each page that is
fetched from that server, where a page may be an HTML document, a 
PHP script, an image, etc.
Each log entry contains information about one page access, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the IP address of the host from which the page request was made
<li> the precise date/time that the request was made
<li> the URL that was requested (path name relative to server document root)
<li> the status of the fetch operation (e.g. 200 = successful, 404 = not found)
<li> the number of bytes of data transferred to the requestor
</ul>
<p>
Here is an example from the start of the March 2005 log from the Apache
web server on <tt>mahler</tt>:

<p>
Some Web-based applications such as WebCMS introduce the notion of a
<q>session</q>
to a user's interaction with the web server. A user logs in to WebCMS,
performs a series of page accesses (e.g. looks the the lecture notes,
reads the message board, etc) and then logs out. All of these accesses
are tied together by being part of a single user's interaction with
the system. In an older version of WebCMS, sessions were implemented
by passing a session
identifier from one PHP script to the next, and checking this against
a copy of the session identifier stored in the database. Thus, while
the web log itself does not store information about users, it is
possible to track an individual user's access to the system by finding
all of the page accesses that make use of the same session identifier.
</p>
<p>
For the purposes of this exercise, imagine that we are interested in
finding out the typical things that people do in a session with WebCMS.
Some of this we can guess: they check the NoticeBoard, take a look
whether there are any new lecture notes, read the current prac exercise,
etc.
Analysing the actual data in detail allows us to either confirm our
hunches or discover new (unexpected) ways in which people use the
system.
Either way, this information could give us ideas on how to tune the
performance of WebCMS.
</p>
<p>
It is very convenient to do this kind of analysis if the data is
loaded into a relational database system, so the first step is to
put the web log data into a relational form that captures the
essential aspects of WebCMS sessions.
Based on this, it is possible to define a database schema to
represent the data from a WebCMS web log:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the IP address and names of various host computers
<li> information about each session using WebCMS, including
	which host it was from and whether the user actually
	logged out via the WebCMS logout page (if they don't
	logout, their session is eventually timed-out)
<li> the details of each individual page access, including
	the name of the script, the parameters, the access time,
	and the session that the access was part of
</ul>
<p>
We use the following ER design:
</p>
<p>
<center>
<table border='1' cellpadding='10' cellspacing='0'><tr><td>
<img src='Pic/schema.png'>
</td></tr></table>
</center>
</p>
which has been converted to a relational schema.
</p>
<pre>
create table Hosts (
	id          integer,
	ipaddr      varchar(20) unique,
	hostname    varchar(100),
	primary key (id)
);

create table Sessions (
	id          int, 
	host        integer,
	complete    boolean,
	primary key (id),
	foreign key (host) references Hosts(id)
);

create table Accesses (
	session     int,
	seq         int,
	course      int,
	page        varchar(200),
	params      varchar(200),
	accTime     timestamp,
	nbytes      integer,
	primary key (session,seq),
	foreign key (session) references Sessions(id)
);
</pre>
<p>
This schema is written in standard SQL, and so will load in any
standard-conforming SQL database management system. 
</p>
<p>
An Apache web-server on the CSE <tt>mahler</tt> runs the WebCMS system.
The web server log for the first three days of March 2005 from this
server was pre-processed to fit the schema above
and is available for you load into a database.
</p>
<p>
The data has been placed into three files, each of which consists
of a large number of SQL insert statements.
</p>
<pre>
-rw-r--r--  1 <i>YOU</i>  <i>YOU</i>  5568874 31 Mar 16:58 Accesses.sql
-rw-r--r--  1 <i>YOU</i>  <i>YOU</i>   172536 31 Mar 16:09 Hosts.sql
-rw-r--r--  1 <i>YOU</i>  <i>YOU</i>   193407 31 Mar 21:03 Sessions.sql
</pre>
<p>
Note that these data files are quite large, so you shouldn't leave
them lying around under your home directory unless you have a large
disk quota. However, it would be feasible to place them under your
<tt>/srvr/<i>YOU</i>/</tt> directory since you have a reasonable
disk quota on <tt>grieg</tt>, which is separate from and additional
to your "home" quota. <font color="red">If your disk on /srvr/YOU is not enough, you should consider delete your previous lab database or the source code of postgres.</font>
</p>
<p>
We have also supplied a copy of the schema to build the database
table structures and a template file for the exercises:
</p>
<pre>
-rw-r--r--  1 <i>YOU</i>  <i>YOU</i>      657 31 Mar 16:10 schema.sql
-rw-r--r--  1 <i>YOU</i>  <i>YOU</i>     2243 31 Mar 16:11 weblog.sql
</pre>
<p>
We have created a <b><a href="weblog.zip">ZIP file</a></b> containing
all of the above files for you to download and use for this Prac.
Since the data files are quite large (e.g. <tt>Accesses.sql</tt> is
5MB), you might want to put them under your <tt>/srvr/<i>YOU</i>/</tt>
directory rather than under your home directory.
Note that you can access <tt>/srvr/<i>YOU</i>/</tt> from an xterm on
any CSE workstation without needing to log in to <tt>grieg</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The first thing to do is to make a directory for this Prac and
extract a copy of the data files into this directory. On the CSE
workstations, you can do this via:
</p>
<pre>
% <b>unzip weblog.zip</b>
</pre>
<p>
while you're in the directory where you want the files to be located.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, if you're working on this at home, you should download
the <a href="weblog.zip">weblog.zip</a> file your home
machine and run the command:
</p>
<pre>
% <b>unzip weblog.zip</b>
</pre>
<p>
In the examples below, we assume that you have already done this.
</p>

<h3>Setting up the PostgreSQL database</h3>
<p>
Once you have copies of the schema and data files,
you can setup a PostgreSQL database for this Prac via the following
sequence of commands on your PostgreSQL server on <tt>grieg</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
% <b>createdb weblog</b>
CREATE DATABASE
% <b>psql weblog -f schema.sql</b>
  <span class="comment">... should produce CREATE TABLE messages ...</span>
% <b>psql weblog -f Hosts.sql</b>
  <span class="comment">... should produce lots of INSERT messages ...</span>
% <b>psql weblog -f Sessions.sql</b>
  <span class="comment">... should produce lots of INSERT messages ...</span>
% <b>psql weblog -f Accesses.sql</b>
  <span class="comment">... should produce lots of INSERT messages ...</span>
</pre>
<p>
Each <tt>INSERT</tt> statement should look like:
</p>
<pre>
INSERT 0 1
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>1</tt> means that one tuple was inserted.
You can insert multiple tuples in a single SQL statement,
so this number could potentially be different to <tt>1</tt>.
The <tt>0</tt> means that no object ID was generated for the new tuple.
PostgreSQL can generate a unique ID for each tuple if you ask.
</p>
<p>
An alternative way of achieving the above is:
</p>
<pre>
% <b>createdb weblog</b>
CREATE DATABASE
% <b>psql weblog</b>
psql (9.3.3)
Type "help" for help.

weblog=#  <b>\i schema.sql</b>
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE
weblog=#  <b>\i Hosts.sql</b>
<span class="comment">... should produce lots of INSERT messages ...</span>
weblog=#  <b>\i Sessions.sql</b>
<span class="comment">... should produce lots of INSERT messages ...</span>
weblog=#  <b>\i Accesses.sql</b>
<span class="comment">... should produce lots of INSERT messages ...</span>
</pre>
<p>
If you don't want to look at all of the <tt>INSERT</tt> messages, and you're using Linux or Mac OSX, then you can do the following:
</p>
<pre>
% <b>createdb weblog</b>
CREATE DATABASE
% <b>psql weblog -f schema.sql</b>
  <span class="comment">... should produce CREATE TABLE messages ...</span>
% <b>(psql weblog -f Hosts.sql 2>&amp;1) > .errs</b>
  <span class="comment">... INSERT messages are added to file .errs ...</span>
% <b>(psql weblog -f Sessions.sql 2>&amp;1) >> .errs</b>
  <span class="comment">... INSERT messages are added to file .errs ...</span>
% <b>(psql weblog -f Accesses.sql 2>&amp;1) >> .errs</b>
  <span class="comment">... INSERT messages are added to file .errs ...</span>
</pre>
<p>
Note that the first loading command has only one <tt>&gt;</tt> to create
the <tt>.errs</tt> file, while the other loading commands use
<tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> to append to the <tt>.errs</tt> file.
A useful command, once you've run the above is:
</p>
<pre>
% <b>grep ERROR .errs</b>
</pre>
<p>
to check for any load-time errors.
If there are any errors (and there shouldn't be), all of the tuples
<em>except</em> the incorrect ones will have been loaded into the
database. Using the line numbers in the error messages, you should
be able to find any erroneous <tt>INSERT</tt> statements and correct
them, and then re-run just those statements.
</p>
<p>
Once the database is loaded, access it via <tt>psql</tt> to check that
everything was loaded ok:
</p>
<pre>
% <b>psql weblog</b>
psql (9.0.3)
Type "help" for help.

weblog=# <b>\d</b>
         List of relations
 Schema |   Name   | Type  | Owner 
--------+----------+-------+-------
 public | accesses | table | <i>YOU</i>
 public | hosts    | table | <i>YOU</i>
 public | sessions | table | <i>YOU</i>
(3 rows)

weblog=# <b>select count(*) from hosts;</b>
 count 
-------
  2213
(1 row)

weblog=# <b>select count(*) from sessions;</b>
 count 
-------
  4610
(1 row)

weblog=# <b>select count(*) from accesses;</b>
 count  
-------
 54490
(1 row)

weblog=# ...
</pre>
<p>
Note that this is a non-trivial-sized database, and if you are not
careful in how you phrase your queries, they make take quite a while
to be answered.
It might be useful to run your <tt>psql</tt> session with timing
output turned on (use <tt>psql</tt>'s <tt>\timing</tt> command to do this).
If a query takes too long to produce a result, see if you can
phrase it differently to get the same answer, but using less time.
</p>
<p>
Another thing to note: the first time you access a table after
creating it (e.g. to run the above counting queries), the query
may be quite slow. On subsequent accesses to the table, it may
be significantly faster. Try re-running the above queries to
see if you observe this. Can you suggest why it's happening?
</p>


<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>
In the questions below, you are required to produce SQL queries
to solve a range of data retrieval problems on this schema.
For each problem, create a view called <tt>Q</tt><i>n</i>
which holds the <q>top-level</q> SQL statement that produces
the answer (this SQL statement may make use of any views defined
earlier in the Prac Exercise). 
In producing a solution for each problem, you may define as many
auxiliary views as you like.
</p>
<p>
To simplify the process of producing these views, a template
file (<a href="weblog.sql"><tt>weblog.sql</tt></a>) is available.
While you're developing your views, you might find it convenient
to edit the views in one window (i.e. edit the <tt>weblog.sql</tt>
file containing the views) and copy-and-paste the view definitions
into another window running <tt>psql</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Note that the order of the results does not matter (except for the
examples where you are imposing an order using <tt>order by</tt>).
As long as you have the same set of tuples, your view is correct.
Remember that, in theory, the output from an SQL query is a set.
</p>
<p>
Once you have completed each of the view definitions, you can
test it simply by typing:
</p>
<pre>
weblog=# <b>select * from Q<i>n</i>;</b>
</pre>
<p>
and observing whether the result matches the expected result
given below.
</p>

<h3>Queries in PostgreSQL</h3>
<ol start='1'>

<li>
<p>
How many of the page accesses occurred on March 2?
</p>
<p>
The results should look like:

<li>
<p>
What are the minimum, average and maximum number of bytes
transferred in a single page access?
Produce all three values in a single tuple, and make sure
that they are all integers.

<p>
WebCMS is divided into modules, where the PHP scripts for each module
is contained in a subdirectory. We can work out the module name by
looking at the first component of the script name (e.g. in the sample
output above, <tt>notice</tt>, <tt>course</tt>, <tt>lecture</tt>, etc.
are modules).
Produce a table of modules and their access frequency (i.e. how
many times each is accessed).

<b>Hint:</b> you'll need to find out more about PostgreSQL
<a href='https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-string.html'>string operators</a>
and
<a href='https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-matching.html#FUNCTIONS-POSIX-REGEXP'>regular expressions</a>.<br>
<b>Note:</b> not all page URLs contain the '/' character;
a page URL that looks simply like <tt>'lecture'</tt> should be treated
as a reference to the lecture module.

The script that maps the web log into relational tuples isn't perfect.
Has it produced any sessions that have no corresponding accesses?
Write a view to print the session IDs of any such sessions.
