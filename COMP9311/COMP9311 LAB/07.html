<h2>1. Aims</h2>

<p>
This exercise aims to get you to: 
<ul>
 <li>obtain some hands-on experience of the PostgreSQL server.</li>
 <li>write correct SQL code to query the database.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Preliminaries</h2>

<p>
Before doing this lab, make sure you:
<ul>
 <li>have installed your PostgreSQL server correctly</li>
 <li>have logged into <tt>grieg</tt>, and executed commands (manually or automatically) to start the database (refer Lab 1).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Just a few reminders:
<ul>
 <li>Use <tt>-- </tt> to add comment to your SQL scripts. 
 <li>end your SQL commands with a semicolon (;).
 <li>string literals are enclosed by single quote (') instead of double quote (").
</ul> 
</p>

<h2>3. Tutorial</h2>

(The complete lab script can be found in <a href="lab07.sql">lab07.sql</a>.)


<h3>3.1. Creating a New Table</h3>

<p>
You can create a new table by specifying the table name, along with
all column names and their types:
</p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE weather (
    city            varchar(80),
    temp_lo         int,           -- low temperature
    temp_hi         int,           -- high temperature
    prcp            real,          -- precipitation
    date            date
);
</pre>

<p>
You can enter this into <tt>psql</tt> with the line breaks. <tt>psql</tt> will
recognize that the command is not terminated until the semicolon.
</p>

<p>
White space (i.e., spaces, tabs, and newlines) may be used freely in
SQL commands. That means you can type the command aligned differently
than above, or even all on one line. Two dashes (&ldquo;<tt>--</tt>&rdquo;) introduce
comments. Whatever follows them is ignored up to the end of the
line. SQL is case insensitive about key words and identifiers, except
when identifiers are double-quoted to preserve the case (not done
above).
</p>

<p>
<tt>varchar(80)</tt> specifies a data type that can store arbitrary character
strings up to 80 characters in length. <tt>int</tt> is the normal integer
type. <tt>real</tt> is a type for storing single precision floating-point
numbers. <tt>date</tt> should be self-explanatory. (Yes, the column of type
<tt>date</tt> is also named <tt>date</tt>. This may be convenient or confusing ---
you choose.)
</p>

<p>
PostgreSQL supports the standard SQL types <tt>int</tt>, <tt>smallint</tt>, <tt>real</tt>,
<tt>double precision</tt>, <tt>char(N)</tt>, <tt>varchar(N)</tt>, <tt>date</tt>, <tt>time</tt>,
<tt>timestamp</tt>, and <tt>interval</tt>, as well as other types of general utility
and a rich set of geometric types. PostgreSQL can be customized with an
arbitrary number of user-defined data types. Consequently, type names are
not syntactical key words, except where required to support special cases
in the SQL standard.
</p>

<p>
The second example will store cities and their associated geographical
location:
</p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE cities (
    name            varchar(80),
    location        point
);
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>point</tt> type is an example of a PostgreSQL-specific data type. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, it should be mentioned that if you don't need a table any
longer or want to recreate it differently you can remove it using the
following command:
</p>

<pre>
DROP TABLE tablename;
</pre>



<h3>3.2. Populating a Table with Rows/Tuples</h3>

<p>
The <tt>INSERT</tt> statement is used to populate a table with rows/tuples:
</p>

<pre>
INSERT INTO weather VALUES ('San Francisco', 46, 50, 0.25, '1994-11-27');
</pre>

<p>
Note that all data types use rather obvious input formats. Constants
that are not simple numeric values usually must be surrounded by
single quotes (<tt>'</tt>), as in the example. The date type is actually quite
flexible in what it accepts, but for this tutorial we will stick to
the unambiguous format shown here. (Also see the functions for
<tt>date</tt>/<tt>time</tt> data types in the documentation)
</p>

<p>
The point type requires a coordinate pair as input, as shown here:
</p>

<pre>
INSERT INTO cities VALUES ('San Francisco', '(-194.0, 53.0)');
</pre>

<p>
The syntax used so far requires you to remember the order of the
columns. An alternative syntax allows you to list the columns
explicitly:
</p>

<pre>
INSERT INTO weather (city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date)
    VALUES ('San Francisco', 43, 57, 0.0, '1994-11-29');
</pre>

<p>
You can list the columns in a different order if you wish or even omit
some columns, e.g., if the precipitation is unknown:
</p>

<pre>
INSERT INTO weather (date, city, temp_hi, temp_lo)
    VALUES ('1994-11-29', 'Hayward', 54, 37);
</pre>

<p>
Many developers consider explicitly listing the columns better style
than relying on the order implicitly.
</p>

<p>
Please enter all the commands shown above so you have some data to
work with in the following sections.
</p>

<h3>3.3. Querying a Table</h3>

<p>
To retrieve data from a table, the table is queried. An SQL <tt>SELECT</tt>
statement is used to do this. The statement is divided into a select
list (the part that lists the columns to be returned), a table list (the
part that lists the tables from which to retrieve the data), and an
optional qualification (the part that specifies any restrictions). For
example, to retrieve all the rows of table <tt>weather</tt>, type:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT * FROM weather;
</pre>

<p>
Here <tt><b></tt> is a shorthand for &ldquo;all columns&rdquo;. (While <tt>SELECT </b></tt> is
useful for off-the-cuff queries, it is widely considered bad style in
production code, since adding a column to the table would change the
results) So the same result would be had with:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date FROM weather;
</pre>

<p>
The output should be:
</p>

<pre>
       city      | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp |    date
  ---------------+---------+---------+------+------------
   San Francisco |      46 |      50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27
   San Francisco |      43 |      57 |    0 | 1994-11-29
   Hayward       |      37 |      54 |      | 1994-11-29
  (3 rows)
</pre>

<p>
You can write expressions, not just simple column references, in the
select list. For example, you can do:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT city, (temp_hi+temp_lo)/2 AS temp_avg, date FROM weather;
</pre>

<p>
This should give:
</p>

<pre>
       city      | temp_avg |    date
  ---------------+----------+------------
   San Francisco |       48 | 1994-11-27
   San Francisco |       50 | 1994-11-29
   Hayward       |       45 | 1994-11-29
  (3 rows)
</pre>

<p>
Notice how the <tt>AS</tt> clause is used to relabel the output
column. (The <tt>AS</tt> clause is optional.)
</p>


<p>
A query can be &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; by adding a <tt>WHERE</tt> clause that specifies
which rows are wanted. The <tt>WHERE</tt> clause contains a Boolean (truth
value) expression, and only rows for which the Boolean expression is
true are returned. The usual Boolean operators (<tt>AND</tt>, <tt>OR</tt>, and
<tt>NOT</tt>) are allowed in the qualification. For example, the following
retrieves the weather of San Francisco on rainy days:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT * FROM weather
WHERE city = 'San Francisco' AND prcp > 0.0;
</pre>

<p>
Result:
</p>

<pre>
       city      | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp |    date
  ---------------+---------+---------+------+------------
   San Francisco |      46 |      50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27
  (1 row)
</pre>

<p>
You can request that the results of a query be returned in sorted order: 
</p>

<pre>
SELECT * FROM weather
ORDER BY city;
</pre>

<pre>
       city      | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp |    date
  ---------------+---------+---------+------+------------
   Hayward       |      37 |      54 |      | 1994-11-29
   San Francisco |      43 |      57 |    0 | 1994-11-29
   San Francisco |      46 |      50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27
</pre>

<p>
In this example, the sort order isn't fully specified, and so you
might get the San Francisco rows in either order. But you'd always get
the results shown above if you do
</p>

<pre>
SELECT * FROM weather
ORDER BY city, temp_lo;
</pre>

<p>
You can request that duplicate rows be removed from the result of a query: 
</p>

<pre>
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM weather;
</pre>

<pre>
       city
  ---------------
   Hayward
   San Francisco
  (2 rows)
</pre>

<p>
Here again, the result row ordering might vary. You can ensure
consistent results by using <tt>DISTINCT</tt> and <tt>ORDER BY</tt> together:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM weather
ORDER BY city;
</pre>

<h3>3.4. Joins between Tables</h3>

<p>
Thus far, our queries have only accessed one table at a time. Queries
can access multiple tables at once, or access the same table in such a
way that multiple rows of the table are being processed at the same
time. A query that accesses multiple rows of the same or different
tables at one time is called a join query. As an example, say you wish
to list all the weather records together with the location of the
associated city. To do that, we need to compare the <tt>city</tt> column of
each row of the <tt>weather</tt> table with the <tt>name</tt> column of all rows in the
<tt>cities</tt> table, and select the pairs of rows where these values match.  
</p>

<div align="center">
<div style="padding: 2mm; width: 18cm;" align="justify">
<b>Note</b>: This is only a conceptual model. The join is usually performed in a more efficient manner than actually comparing each possible pair of rows, but this is invisible to the user.  
</div>
</div>

<p>
This would be accomplished by the following query:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT *
FROM weather, cities
WHERE city = name;
</pre>

<pre>
       city      | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp |    date    |     name      | location
  ---------------+---------+---------+------+------------+---------------+-----------
   San Francisco |      46 |      50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27 | San Francisco | (-194,53)
   San Francisco |      43 |      57 |    0 | 1994-11-29 | San Francisco | (-194,53)
  (2 rows)
</pre>

<p>
Observe two things about the result set: 
<ul>
 <li><p>There is no result row for the city of <tt>Hayward</tt>. This is
	  because there is no matching entry in the <tt>cities</tt> table for
	  <tt>Hayward</tt>, so the join ignores the unmatched rows in the
	  <tt>weather</tt> table. We will see shortly how this can be fixed.
 <li><p>There are two columns containing the city name. This is correct
	  because the lists of columns of the <tt>weather</tt> and the <tt>cities</tt>
	  table are concatenated. In practice this is undesirable, though,
	  so you will probably want to list the output columns explicitly
	  rather than using <tt>*</tt>:
</ul>
</p>

<pre>
SELECT city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date, location
FROM weather, cities
WHERE city = name;
</pre>

<div align="center">
<div style="padding: 2mm; width: 18cm;" align="justify">
*Exercise*: Attempt to find out the semantics of this query when the <tt>WHERE</tt> clause is omitted.
</div>
</div>

<p>
Since the columns all had different names, the parser automatically
found out which table they belong to. If there were duplicate column
names in the two tables you'd need to qualify the column names to show
which one you meant, as in:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT weather.city, weather.temp_lo, weather.temp_hi,
       weather.prcp, weather.date, cities.location
FROM weather, cities
WHERE cities.name = weather.city;
</pre>

<p>
It is widely considered good style to qualify all column names in a
join query, so that the query won't fail if a duplicate column name is
later added to one of the tables.
</p>

<p>
Join queries of the kind seen thus far can also be written in this alternative form: 
</p>

<pre>
SELECT *
FROM weather INNER JOIN cities ON (weather.city = cities.name);
</pre>

<p>
This syntax is not as commonly used as the one above, but we show it
here to help you understand the following topics.
</p>

<p>
Now we will figure out how we can get the <tt>Hayward</tt> records back
in. What we want the query to do is to scan the <tt>weather</tt> table and
for each row to find the matching cities row(s). If no matching row is
found we want some &ldquo;empty values&rdquo; to be substituted for the cities
table's columns. This kind of query is called an _outer join<em>. (The
joins we have seen so far are </em>inner joins_.) The command looks like
this:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT *
FROM weather LEFT OUTER JOIN cities ON (weather.city = cities.name);
</pre>

<pre>
       city      | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp |    date    |     name      | location
  ---------------+---------+---------+------+------------+---------------+-----------
   Hayward       |      37 |      54 |      | 1994-11-29 |               |
   San Francisco |      46 |      50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27 | San Francisco | (-194,53)
   San Francisco |      43 |      57 |    0 | 1994-11-29 | San Francisco | (-194,53)
  (3 rows)
</pre>

<p>
This query is called a _left outer join_ because the table mentioned on the
left of the join operator will have each of its rows in the output at least
once, whereas the table on the right will only have those rows output that
match some row of the left table. When outputting a left-table row for
which there is no right-table match, empty (null) values are substituted
for the right-table columns.
</p>

<div align="center">
<div style="padding: 2mm; width: 18cm;" align="justify">
<b>Exercise</b>: There are also right outer joins and full outer joins. Try to find out what those do.
</div>
</div>

<p>
We can also join a table against itself. This is called a <em>self
join</em>. As an example, suppose we wish to find all the weather records
that are in the temperature range of other weather records. So we need
to compare the <tt>temp_lo</tt> and <tt>temp_hi</tt> columns of each weather row to the
<tt>temp<em>lo</tt> and <tt>temp</em>hi</tt> columns of all other weather rows. We can do this
with the following query:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT W1.city, W1.temp_lo AS low, W1.temp_hi AS high,
       W2.city, W2.temp_lo AS low, W2.temp_hi AS high
FROM weather W1, weather W2
WHERE W1.temp_lo < W2.temp_lo
AND W1.temp_hi > W2.temp_hi;
</pre>

<pre>
       city      | low | high |     city      | low | high
  ---------------+-----+------+---------------+-----+------
   San Francisco |  43 |   57 | San Francisco |  46 |   50
   Hayward       |  37 |   54 | San Francisco |  46 |   50
  (2 rows)
</pre>

<p>
Here we have relabeled the <tt>weather</tt> table as <tt>W1</tt> and <tt>W2</tt> to be able to distinguish the left and right side of the join. You can also use these kinds of aliases in other queries to save some typing, e.g.:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT *
FROM weather w, cities c
WHERE w.city = c.name;
</pre>

<p>
You will encounter this style of abbreviating quite frequently.
</p>

<h3>3.5. Aggregate Functions</h3>

<p>
Like most other relational database products, PostgreSQL supports
aggregate functions. An aggregate function computes a single result
from multiple input rows. For example, there are aggregates to compute
the count, sum, avg (average), max (maximum) and min (minimum) over a
set of rows.
</p>

<p>
As an example, we can find the highest low-temperature reading anywhere with 
</p>

<pre>
SELECT max(temp_lo) FROM weather;
</pre>

<pre>
   max
  -----
    46
  (1 row)
</pre>

<p>
If we wanted to know what city (or cities) that reading occurred in, we might try
</p>

<pre>
SELECT city FROM weather WHERE temp_lo = max(temp_lo);     -- WRONG
</pre>

<p>
but this will not work since the aggregate <tt>max</tt> cannot be used
in the <tt>WHERE</tt> clause. (This restriction exists because the
<tt>WHERE</tt> clause determines which rows will be included in the
aggregate calculation; so obviously it has to be evaluated before
aggregate functions are computed.) However, as is often the case
the query can be restated to accomplish the desired result, here
by using a <b>subquery</b>:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT city FROM weather
WHERE temp_lo = (SELECT max(temp_lo) FROM weather);
</pre>

<pre>
       city
  ---------------
   San Francisco
  (1 row)
</pre>

<p>
This is OK because the subquery is an independent computation that
computes its own aggregate separately from what is happening in the
outer query.
</p>

<p>
Aggregates are also very useful in combination with <tt>GROUP BY</tt>
clauses. For example, we can get the maximum low temperature observed
in each city with
</p>

<pre>
SELECT city, max(temp_lo)
FROM weather
GROUP BY city;
</pre>

<pre>
       city      | max
  ---------------+-----
   Hayward       |  37
   San Francisco |  46
  (2 rows)
</pre>

<p>
which gives us one output row per city. Each aggregate result is
computed over the table rows matching that city. We can filter these
grouped rows using <tt>HAVING</tt>:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT city, max(temp_lo)
FROM weather
GROUP BY city
HAVING max(temp_lo) < 40;
</pre>

<pre>
    city   | max
  ---------+-----
   Hayward |  37
  (1 row)
</pre>

<p>
which gives us the same results for only the cities that have all
<tt>temp_lo</tt> values below 40. Finally, if we only care about cities
whose names begin with &ldquo;<tt>S</tt>&rdquo;, we might do
</p>

<pre>
SELECT city, max(temp_lo)
FROM weather
WHERE city LIKE 'S%'
GROUP BY city
HAVING max(temp_lo) < 40;
</pre>

(The <tt>LIKE</tt> operator does pattern matching.)

<p>
It is important to understand the interaction between aggregates and
SQL's <tt>WHERE</tt> and <tt>HAVING</tt> clauses. The fundamental difference
between <tt>WHERE</tt> and <tt>HAVING</tt> is this: <tt>WHERE</tt> selects input
<b>rows</b> <em>before</em> groups and aggregates are computed (thus, it controls
which rows go into the aggregate computation), whereas <tt>HAVING</tt>
selects <b>group</b> rows <em>after</em> groups and aggregates are computed. Thus,
the <tt>WHERE</tt> clause must not contain aggregate functions; it makes no
sense to try to use an aggregate to determine which rows will be
inputs to the aggregates. On the other hand, the <tt>HAVING</tt> clause
always contains aggregate functions. (Strictly speaking, you are
allowed to write a <tt>HAVING</tt> clause that doesn't use aggregates, but
it's seldom useful. The same condition could be used more efficiently
at the <tt>WHERE</tt> stage.)
</p>

<p>
In the previous example, we can apply the city name restriction in
<tt>WHERE</tt>, since it needs no aggregate. This is more efficient than
adding the restriction to HAVING, because we avoid doing the grouping
and aggregate calculations for all rows that fail the <tt>WHERE</tt> check.
</p>


<h3>3.6. Updates</h3>

<p>
You can update existing rows using the <tt>UPDATE</tt> command. Suppose
you discover the temperature readings are all off by 2 degrees after
November 28. You may correct the data as follows:
</p>

<pre>
UPDATE weather
SET temp_hi = temp_hi - 2,  temp_lo = temp_lo - 2
WHERE date > '1994-11-28';
</pre>

<p>
Look at the new state of the data:
</p>

<pre>
SELECT * FROM weather;
</pre>

<pre>
       city      | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp |    date
  ---------------+---------+---------+------+------------
   San Francisco |      46 |      50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27
   San Francisco |      41 |      55 |    0 | 1994-11-29
   Hayward       |      35 |      52 |      | 1994-11-29
  (3 rows)
</pre>

<h3>3.7. Deletions</h3>

<p>
Rows can be removed from a table using the <tt>DELETE</tt> command. Suppose
you are no longer interested in the weather of <tt>Hayward</tt>. Then you
can do the following to delete those rows from the table:
</p>

<pre>
DELETE FROM weather WHERE city = 'Hayward';
</pre>

<p>
All weather records belonging to <tt>Hayward</tt> are removed.
</p>

<pre>
SELECT * FROM weather;
</pre>

<pre>
       city      | temp_lo | temp_hi | prcp |    date
  ---------------+---------+---------+------+------------
   San Francisco |      46 |      50 | 0.25 | 1994-11-27
   San Francisco |      41 |      55 |    0 | 1994-11-29
  (2 rows)
</pre>

<p>
One should be wary of statements of the form
</p>

<pre>
DELETE FROM tablename;
</pre>

<p>
Without a qualification, <tt>DELETE</tt> will remove all rows from the given
table, leaving it empty. The system will not request confirmation before
doing this!
</p>


<h3>3.8. Foreign Keys</h3>

<p>
Consider the following problem: You want to make sure that no one can
insert rows in the <tt>weather</tt> table that do not have a matching entry
in the <tt>cities</tt> table. This is called maintaining the <em>referential
integrity</em> of your data. In simplistic database systems this would be
implemented (if at all) by first looking at the cities table to check
if a matching record exists, and then inserting or rejecting the new
weather records. This approach has a number of problems and is very
inconvenient, so PostgreSQL can do this for you by adding the
referential integrity constraint into the <tt>CREATE TABLE</tt> statements.
</p>

<p>
The new declaration of the tables would look like this:
</p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE cities (
        city     varchar(80) primary key,
        location point
);

CREATE TABLE weather (
        city      varchar(80) references cities(city),
        temp_lo   int,
        temp_hi   int,
        prcp      real,
        date      date
);
</pre>

<p>
Now try inserting an invalid record:
</p>

<pre>
INSERT INTO weather VALUES ('Berkeley', 45, 53, 0.0, '1994-11-28');

ERROR:  insert or update on table "weather" violates foreign key constraint "weather_city_fkey"
DETAIL:  Key (city)=(Berkeley) is not present in table "cities".
</pre>

<p>
The behavior of foreign keys can be finely tuned to your application. We
will not go beyond this simple example in this tutorial, but just refer
you to Chapter 5 in PostgreSQL documentation for more information. Making
correct use of foreign keys will definitely improve the quality of your
database applications, so you are strongly encouraged to learn about
them.
</p>

<h3>3.9. Views</h3>

<p>
Suppose the combined listing of weather records and city location is
of particular interest to your application, but you do not want to
type the join query each time you need it. You can create a view over
the query, which gives a name to the query that you can refer to like
an ordinary table.
</p>

<pre>
CREATE VIEW myview AS
SELECT city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date, location
FROM weather, cities
WHERE city = name;

SELECT * FROM myview;
</pre>

<p>
Making liberal use of views is a key aspect of good SQL database
design. Views allow you to encapsulate the details of the structure
of your tables, which may change as your application evolves, behind
consistent interfaces.
</p>

<p>
Views can be used in almost any place a real table can be used. Building
views upon other views is not uncommon.
</p>

<h3>3.10. Transactions</h3>

<p>
Transactions are a fundamental concept of all database systems. The essential point of a transaction is that it bundles multiple steps into
a single, all-or-nothing operation. The intermediate states between the steps are not visible to other concurrent transactions, and if some
failure occurs that prevents the transaction from completing, then none of the steps affect the database at all.
</p>

<p>
For example, consider a bank database that contains balances for various customer accounts, as well as total deposit balances for
branches. Suppose that we want to record a payment of $100.00 from Alice's account to Bob's account. Simplifying outrageously, the SQL
commands for this might look like:
</p>

<pre>
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Alice';
UPDATE branches SET balance = balance - 100.00
    WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice');
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Bob';
UPDATE branches SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Bob');
</pre>

<p>
The details of these commands are not important here; the <em>important point</em> is that there are several separate updates involved to accomplish this rather simple operation. Our bank's officers will want to be assured that either all these updates happen, or none of them happen. It would certainly not do for a system failure to result in Bob receiving $100.00 that was not debited from Alice. Nor would Alice long remain a happy customer if she was debited without Bob being credited. We need a guarantee that if something goes wrong partway through the operation, none of the steps executed so far will take effect. Grouping the updates into a transaction gives us this
guarantee. A transaction is said to be <b>atomic</b>: from the point of view of other transactions, it either happens completely or not at all.
</p>


<p>
We also want a guarantee that once a transaction is completed and acknowledged by the database system, it has indeed been permanently
recorded and won't be lost even if a crash ensues shortly thereafter. For example, if we are recording a cash withdrawal by Bob,
we do not want any chance that the debit to his account will disappear in a crash just after he walks out the bank door. A transactional
database guarantees that all the updates made by a transaction are logged in permanent storage (i.e., on disk) before the transaction is
reported complete.
</p>


<p>
Another important property of transactional databases is closely related to the notion of atomic updates: when multiple transactions
are running concurrently, each one should not be able to see the incomplete changes made by others. For example, if one transaction
is busy totalling all the branch balances, it would not do for it to include the debit from Alice's branch but not the credit to Bob's
branch, nor vice versa. So transactions must be all-or-nothing not only in terms of their permanent effect on the database, but also in
terms of their visibility as they happen. The updates made so far by an open transaction are invisible to other transactions until the
transaction completes, whereupon all the updates become visible simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
A transaction has the following ACID properties: <b>A</b>utomicity, <b>C</b>onsistency, <b>I</b>solation, and <b>D</b>urability.
</p>

<p>
In PostgreSQL, a transaction is set up by surrounding the SQL commands of the transaction with <tt>BEGIN</tt> and <tt>COMMIT</tt> commands. So our banking transaction would actually look like:
</p>

<pre>
  BEGIN;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00
      WHERE name = 'Alice';
  -- etc etc
  COMMIT;
</pre>

<p>
If, partway through the transaction, we decide we do not want to commit (perhaps we just noticed that Alice's balance went negative),
we can issue the command <tt>ROLLBACK</tt> instead of <tt>COMMIT</tt>, and all our updates so far will be canceled.
</p>

<p>
PostgreSQL actually treats every SQL statement as being executed within a transaction.
If you do not issue a <tt>BEGIN</tt> command, then each individual statement has an implicit <tt>BEGIN</tt> and (if successful) <tt>COMMIT</tt> wrapped around it. A group of statements surrounded by <tt>BEGIN</tt> and <tt>COMMIT</tt> is sometimes called a transaction block.
